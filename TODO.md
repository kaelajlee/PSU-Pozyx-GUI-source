#Pozyx To Do List

##Short Term
Look through code to find out why 2D sometimes won't run. Thinking first velocity empty or zero
Change "center" to "earth" and "outer" to "observed" in graphing 2D
Plot points and lines rather than just lines
Plot the (0,0) Earth tag under the Earth Center transform
  Figuring out how to plot multiple data sets on same graph
Figure out why when Angular Earth Center transform on, and one tag accurate and other invalid, plots angle 0
Number of points option on graphing 2D not working

##Medium Term
Research and test whether Ptolemaic Model (wrong model) gives same retrograde data

##Long Term
Writing up math of coordinate transforms
Adding -pi to pi ticks on the Angle transform
